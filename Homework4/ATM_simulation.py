# Question 1
# Simple ATM program
# Using exception handling code blocks such as try/ except / else / finally, write a
# program that simulates an ATM machine to withdraw money.
# (NB: the more code blocks the better, but try to use at least two key words e.g.
# try/except)
# I am a bank machine
#
# TASK 2 (Exception Handling)
